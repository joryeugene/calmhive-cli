## üî• Killer Features

### Adaptive Retry with Usage Limits
Ever had an overnight task die at iteration 10 due to usage limits? Not anymore!

```
Iteration 10 ‚úì
‚ö†Ô∏è Usage limit detected
‚è≥ Waiting 60s before retry...
‚è≥ Waiting 120s before retry...
‚úÖ Iteration 11 started!
```

Calmhive automatically detects and handles usage limits with exponential backoff.

### Sleep Prevention for Long Sessions
Your MacBook won't sleep during long AFk sessions:

```
‚òï Sleep prevention enabled (caffeinate PID: 12345)
üöÄ Starting iteration 1 of 50
... runs all night without interruption ...
‚òï Sleep prevention disabled (caffeinate stopped)
```

Automatic for sessions >5 iterations, disable with `--no-prevent-sleep`.

### Automatic Context Compression
When Claude hits context limits, Calmhive automatically attempts multiple strategies to compress the conversation:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Context limit approaching
üóúÔ∏è Attempting context compression...
‚úÖ Context compressed successfully!
```

Features:
- Multiple `/compact` command formats for compatibility
- Automatic retry with different compression strategies
- Context usage monitoring and reporting
- Fallback manual compression if needed

## üö¶ What's Next?

After installation:
1. Run `calmhive chat` to start interactive mode
2. Try `calmhive run "create a hello world script"` for automation
3. Use `calmhive voice` to enable voice control
4. Explore with `calmhive --help`

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Use Different Models
```bash
calmhive chat --model opus "complex analysis"
calmhive run --model sonnet "standard task"
```

### Pipe Input/Output
```bash
cat code.js | calmhive chat -p "review this"
calmhive run "generate SQL schema" > schema.sql
```

### Custom AFk Iterations
```bash
# Simple prompt mode
calmhive afk "task" --simple --iterations 5

# Advanced mode with sequential thinking
calmhive afk "complex task" --custom-steps --iterations 25
```

## üîß Installation Troubleshooting

**Command not found after npm install?**
```bash
# Add npm global binaries to PATH:
export PATH="$PATH:$(npm prefix -g)/bin"

# Or find where npm installs global packages:
npm prefix -g
```

**Permission errors with npm?**
```bash
# Use npx to run without global install:
npx @calmhive/calmhive-cli chat "hello"

# Or use the git clone method above for full control
```

**Git clone setup example:**
```bash
# Create repos directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $HOME/repos

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/joryeugene/calmhive-cli.git $HOME/repos/calmhive-cli

# Add to PATH (macOS/zsh)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/repos/calmhive-cli/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash users (or Linux):
# echo 'export PATH="$HOME/repos/calmhive-cli/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# source ~/.bashrc

# Test it works
calmhive --help
```

**Claude CLI missing?**
Install from [claude.ai/claude-cli](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-cli)

**Best with Claude Max!**
While Pro/Teams work great, Claude Max offers the highest rate limits for heavy automation workflows.

**Voice not working?**
```bash
# Install uv package manager if needed (macOS):
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Set OpenAI API key:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Start voice interface:
calmhive voice
```
> üì± **Platform Note**: Voice features are optimized for macOS. Linux/Windows compatibility may vary.

**MCP Tools not available?**
Calmhive requires Claude Max, Pro, or Teams subscription for MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. With Claude Free, basic chat/run commands work but advanced features are limited.

**Need detailed MCP setup?**
See our comprehensive [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions on configuring essential tools like Sequential Thinking and OmniSearch.

# Templates are .md files that need to be copied to Claude's commands directory
cp -r "$(npm root -g)/@calmhive/calmhive-cli/commands/"*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Then use them in interactive chat sessions with /user:
calmhive chat
> /user:bug-hunting
> Find memory leaks in this application

# Or load expert personas:
> /user:expert-frontend-engineer
> Optimize this React component for performance
```

Note: Templates can only be invoked with `/user:command-name` in interactive sessions.

### üîÑ AFk Session Best Practices

**Sleep Prevention**
```bash
# Automatic for >5 iterations - your Mac stays awake!
calmhive afk "big project" --iterations 20  # ‚òï caffeinate enabled

# Disable if you prefer manual sleep control
calmhive afk "small task" --iterations 8 --no-prevent-sleep
```

**Stopping AFk Sessions**
```bash
# ‚ùå DON'T use Ctrl+C (won't work - AFk runs in background)
# ‚úÖ DO use proper stop command:
calmhive afk stop <session-id>
```

**Continue Where You Left Off**
```bash
# After an AFk session completes, pick up the conversation:
calmhive chat -c  # Claude remembers the context!
```

**Monitor Progress**
```bash
calmhive afk status           # See all sessions
calmhive afk tail <session>   # Watch live logs
calmhive tui                  # Visual interface
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

**Mixed Console Output**
If you see iterations jumping (1 ‚Üí 3), you may have multiple AFk processes:
```bash
ps aux | grep "commands/afk"  # Check for duplicates
kill <pid>                    # Kill orphan processes
```

**Long Tasks Timing Out**
AFk sessions can run for hours - no artificial timeouts!
```bash
# These will run as long as needed:
calmhive afk "complex refactoring" -i 30
calmhive afk "comprehensive testing" -i 69  # Max iterations increased!
```

**Usage Limit Recovery**
Calmhive automatically handles rate limits with exponential backoff:
```
‚úÖ Iteration 5 complete
‚ö†Ô∏è Usage limit detected
‚è≥ Waiting 30s ‚Üí 1m ‚Üí 2m ‚Üí 4m...
‚úÖ Iteration 6 started!
```

### üöÄ Workflow Power Tips

**Real Morning Workflow (verified commands)**
```bash
# 1. Check what happened overnight
calmhive t                    # TUI shows all sessions, navigate with j/k, Enter for details

# 2. Continue conversation from where AFk left off
calmhive c -c "What did you accomplish? Show me the changes."

# 3. View logs from specific session (if needed)
calmhive a tail afk-abc12345  # Live/historical logs

# 4. Clean up old sessions periodically
calmhive a cleanup 7          # Remove sessions older than 7 days
```

**Production-Ready Automation Workflows**
```bash
# Daily ESLint Deep Scan & Auto-Fix (comprehensive code quality)
calmhive schedule create "every day at 6am" \
  "calmhive afk 'Perform comprehensive ESLint analysis on the entire codebase. Run eslint on all JavaScript files in lib/, cmd/, and test/ directories to get a full diagnostic report. Categorize all warnings by type (no-unused-vars, prefer-const, no-case-declarations, etc). For the top 5 most common warning types, systematically fix 10 instances of each type, ensuring proper variable usage or safe removal of dead code. After each fix, run the specific test file related to that module to ensure no regressions. Create a detailed report showing: total warnings before/after, warnings fixed by category, any code patterns that need manual review. If any tests fail, revert that specific fix and document why it needs manual intervention. Finally, commit all successful fixes with a message detailing each category of fixes made.' --iterations 10"

# Weekly Security Audit & Patching
calmhive schedule create "every Monday at 8am" \
  "calmhive afk 'Conduct comprehensive security audit of all npm dependencies. Run npm audit to identify vulnerabilities. For each vulnerability found, research the security advisory details, understand the attack vector, and evaluate the impact on our codebase. For critical and high severity issues, check if patches are available and test them in isolation. Update all dependencies that have security patches available, running the full test suite after each update to ensure compatibility. Generate a security report including: vulnerabilities found, patches applied, dependencies that need manual updates, and any temporary mitigations implemented. Commit the updated package-lock.json with detailed notes about each security fix.' --iterations 8"

# Template-driven bug investigation  
calmhive afk "$(calmhive template apply bug-fix \
  ISSUE_DESCRIPTION='memory leak in auth service')" --iterations 8

# Schedule template-based workflows
calmhive schedule create "every Friday at 4pm" \
  "calmhive afk '$(calmhive template apply performance-optimization \
  TARGET_SYSTEM=api-server)' --iterations 8"
```

**TUI Power Navigation (tested shortcuts)**
```bash
calmhive t                    # Launch TUI
# Inside TUI:
# gg = Go to top, G = Go to bottom  
# j/k = Navigate up/down (vim style)
# Enter = View session details
# l = View logs, s = Stop session
# q = Quit, n = New session
```

**Smart Model Selection**
```bash
calmhive chat --model sonnet "standard work"     # Balanced (default)
calmhive afk --model sonnet "standard work" -i 5 # Balanced performance
calmhive chat --model opus "complex analysis"    # Most capable
```

**Pipe Workflows**
```bash
# Process files through Claude
find . -name "*.js" | calmhive chat -p "list potential bugs in these files"

# Generate and save output
calmhive run "create comprehensive test suite" > test-plan.md
```

**Using Prompt Files**
```bash
# Pass a markdown file as AFk task description
calmhive afk "$(cat prompt.md)" --iterations 20

# Use complex prompts from files
calmhive chat "$(cat detailed-instructions.md)"
calmhive run "$(cat build-script-prompt.md)"
```

**Voice + AFk Combo**
```bash
# Start voice interface
calmhive voice

# Say: "Start an AFk session to refactor the entire authentication system with 20 iterations"
# Then monitor with TUI while doing other work!
```

### üéØ Pro Tips

- **Context Continuity**: Use `chat -c` after AFk to maintain conversation history
- **Background Monitoring**: Keep `calmhive tui` open in a separate terminal
- **Smart Iterations**: 5-15 iterations for most tasks, 20+ for major refactoring
- **Clean Shutdown**: Always use `afk stop` instead of killing terminals
- **Model Efficiency**: Sonnet for most work (default), Opus for complex reasoning

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Calmhive gives Claude direct access to your system through powerful automation tools. While this enables incredible productivity, it also means Claude can execute any command, modify files, or make network requests. A misunderstood instruction could potentially cause data loss or system changes.

**‚úÖ Essential safety practices:**
- **Backup your data** - Maintain regular backups of important files and projects
- **Use version control** - Keep your code in Git repositories with remote backups  
- **Review automation** - Monitor what commands Claude executes, especially in AFk mode
- **Start small** - Test with simple tasks before running complex automations
- **Monitor tool usage** - Some MCP tools have their own API costs (search engines, etc.)

**üîí Built-in safeguards:**
- All commands are logged for review (`calmhive tui` to monitor)
- Background tasks can be stopped anytime (`calmhive afk stop <session>`)
- No elevated permissions required (runs as your user)
- Process isolation for AFk sessions

> **üí° Bottom line**: Calmhive is a powerful automation tool that amplifies both your capabilities and potential risks. Use it thoughtfully, maintain good backup habits, and start with simple tasks to build confidence.

## üíª Platform Compatibility

**Primary Platform**: macOS
- ‚úÖ Fully tested and optimized
- ‚úÖ All features supported (voice, TUI, AFk background processing)
- ‚úÖ Native integrations (caffeinate for sleep prevention, etc.)

**Linux**: Limited support
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic commands work (chat, run, afk)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Voice features may require additional setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è TUI navigation tested but some features may vary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Background processing should work but less tested

**Windows**: Experimental
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Core functionality may work with WSL
- ‚ùå Voice features not supported
- ‚ùå Some shell-specific features may not work
- ‚ùå Not recommended for production use

> **Recommendation**: For the best Calmhive experience, use macOS. Linux users can try it but expect some rough edges. Windows users should consider WSL or wait for better cross-platform support.
